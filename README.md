Polish: An escape room makes the player pay attention to detail in order to find clues. The goal is to unlock the hell door to escape the room. In the end, the player can't never escape the room even they have unlock the last door because behind the door is hell. We created each clue carries its uniqueness and places in different setting that brings to the player the feeling of curiosity and excitement. We also added some dim lights such as bulbs and candles to create the spooky atmosphere.
